<summary mdxType="summary">[Arg] provider -> input: nasdaq -> Input should be 'fmp' or 'yfinance'</summary>

There could be a few reasons for this message.

1. The provider supplied is not installed, in which case install it and follow the next step.

2. The provider extension is installed, but the static assets have not been refreshed. Rebuild the static assets from the command line with:

```sh
python -c "import openbb;openbb.build()"
```

An environment variable to auto-build the static assets on import - if there are changes to the installed configuration - can be defined as:

```env
OPENBB_AUTO_BUILD="true"
```

The expected behaviour is for this to be "true" by default, however can be situations where the flag does not trigger a build.
Manually invoke the process from the command line if necessary.

3. Not every endpoint is supported by every provider. To see the coverage of commands and data providers within the current installation, use `reference` property in the app. The docstring for each function contains the same information as the code block below. 

```python
from openbb import obb

path = "/index/available"

[d for d in obb.reference["paths"][path]["parameters"] if d != "standard"]
```
```sh
['cboe', 'fmp', 'tmx', 'yfinance']
```

Complete breakdowns of query and return fields by provider and endpoint are available under the [Reference](/platform/reference)

<summary mdxType="summary">AttributeError: 'App' object has no attribute 'some attribute'</summary>

There could be a few reasons for this message that are similar to the issue above.

1. The extension is not installed.
  - Install it and rebuild the static files (described in the item above.)
2. No installed provider extension services an endpoint within the router.
  - Under these conditions, the router is excluded from the app factory.
3. The extension is installed, a provider does service the router, but the static assets have not been rebuilt.
  - Rebuild the static files (described in the item above.)

<summary mdxType="summary">OpenBBError: [Error] -> Unexpected error.</summary>

Also a 500 error from the API. It is the result of an unhandled exception.

Traceback messages are truncated unless the debug environment variable is set.

```python
import os

os.environ["OPENBB_DEBUG_MODE"] = "true"

from openbb import obb

# run the syntax that created the error and the full traceback will print to the console.
```

If the issue originates from OpenBB code, please open a bug issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/OpenBB/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%3Abug&projects=&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBug%5D)

Be sure to include the contents of the traceback, the operating system and version, Python version, and the syntax responsible for the error.

</details>

<details>
<summary mdxType="summary">EmptyDataError: The request was returned empty.</summary>

Also a 204 status code from the API. It means that the data was returned empty but the operation was a success.

There might not be anything wrong, or it could be the result of parameter choices. In which case, widen the scope of the query to capture output.

Some sources will return bad requests with a 200 status code and no message.

If all parameter permutations are only capable of returning an empty response, please open a bug issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/OpenBB/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%3Abug&projects=&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBug%5D) with the operating system and version, Python version, and the syntax responsible for the error.

<summary mdxType="summary">How do I start in debug mode?</summary>

Debug mode can be set as an environment variable, in `~/openbb_platform/.env`, as:

```env
OPENBB_DEBUG_MODE=true
```

It can be invoked for the current session only by adding this code before importing the OpenBB package.

```python
import os

os.environ["OPENBB_DEBUG_MODE"] = "true"

from openbb import obb
```
