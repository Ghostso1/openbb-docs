In the realm of investment research, financial data often comes in tabular form. This is because it's predominantly quantitative, and analysts and quants frequently need to delve into the raw data to make informed decisions. To enhance your navigation experience through this data, we've incorporated basic data manipulation capabilities.

* **Column Resizing**: You have the flexibility to manually adjust the width of the table columns. Alternatively, you can use the "Autosize all columns" feature for automatic resizing.

* **Column Reorganization**: Reorganize your columns effortlessly with our drag-and-drop feature. Simply click and hold the mouse on the column header and drag it to your desired position.

* **Column Filtering**: To reduce visual clutter, you can temporarily hide any columns that aren't currently relevant to your analysis. This can be done easily in the column settings.

* **Sorting**: By clicking on a column header, you can sort the data in ascending or descending order based on that column's values.

* **Transposing**: Our platform allows you to transpose tables, turning columns into rows and vice versa. This feature can be particularly useful for rendering time series from tabular data.

## Chart from raw data

In the world of investment research, data is king. But raw, tabular data can be overwhelming and difficult to interpret. That's where charts come in. They transform complex data sets into visual narratives, making it easier to spot trends, compare variables, and make informed decisions.

With OpenBB Terminal Pro, you can create charts directly from your tabular data. Simply select the data you want to visualize, choose your preferred charting style, and let the software do the rest. It's a powerful tool for quants and analysts alike.
