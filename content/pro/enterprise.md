Our product offers two different plans:
    - **OpenBB Terminal** - Free version for individuals
    - **OpenBB Terminal Pro** - Enterprise for teams and professionals

The products, features and services that come with an enterprise are mentioned below.

## Excel Add-In

The enterprise plan, enables users to have access to the financial data directly from Excel, or export any dataset into an Excel format.

For more information, check [OpenBB Add-in for Excel](http://docs.openbb.co/excel).

## Export Data

Users are able to export any data from OpenBB, either in CSV, JSON, XLSX or other format. This is achieved by having redistribution rights on the data.

## Native Integrations

The free plan allows users to bring data from API endpoints, file uploads and custom backends. These [custom backends](https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/backend-for-terminal-pro/tree/main) enable users to connect to databases/datawarehouses like Snowflake, Databricks, Elastic, Clickhouse, etc but the user experience isn't optimal.

Hence, enterprise users will have access to our data connector which enables users to connect to their database/data warehouse in a way that is secure and set up in seconds instead of hours. Supported connections are: Snowflake, SQLite and MySQL. More are under way.

## Dashboard Sharing

Keep your dashboards private and securely accessible only to your organization. Upon signing up, we’ll create an organization account for you and your team. You can grant specific team members access to dashboards.

## Team Management

Gain access to a user management portal where you can manage access to your firm’s workspace. You can invite or remove members, export the entire user list, and view their last login times.

## AI Copilot resources

You will have generous access to both file uploads and Copilot, with 100 requests per hour. If you need additional requests, you can bring your own OpenAI key or contact us.
