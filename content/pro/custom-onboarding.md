<HeadTitle title="Enterprise Onboarding | OpenBB Terminal Pro Docs" />

Our product offers two different plans: OpenBB Terminal for individual users and OpenBB Terminal Pro for professionals. Terminal Pro is designed for teams involved in investment analysis, due diligence, and capital allocation, providing enhanced security, compliance, and collaboration features.


## Team Collaboration

1. **Database Integration**: 
In addition to existing data connection methods like API endpoints, custom backends, or file uploads, Terminal Pro also enables direct connections to your database, whether it’s a local SQLite or MySQL instance, or cloud solutions like Snowflake.

2. **Excel Add-in**: 
With Terminal Pro, you can access raw data beyond just the display version. This functionality is available through our Excel Add-in (see how to get started here), or you can export data in Excel or CSV format.

3. **Bring Custom Copilot**: 
Integrating your custom Copilot is as simple as connecting your data. See [here](/pro/bring-your-own-copilot.md) for instructions on configuring your Copilot to meet your security and compliance requirements.

4. **PDF Reports**: 
Easily export your dashboards to PDF with a single click. Learn how to generate PDF reports [here](/pro/dashboards.md)

5. **Private & Secure Dashboard Sharing**: 
Keep your dashboards private and securely accessible only to your organization. Upon signing up, we’ll create an organization account for you and your team. You can grant specific team members access to dashboards.

6. **Security Bolt-On & Support**
When you sign up for OpenBB Terminal Pro, you will gain access to a User Management Portal where you can manage access to your firm’s workspace. You can invite or remove members, export the entire user list, and view their last login times.
